# 60 applications

**Canonical SQL:** [schema.sql](schema.sql). This module is assembled into the versioned Supabase migration by `database/scripts/build_migration.py`. Do not run this file separately after applying the bundled migration.

Per-user application tracker. One row per user and opportunity. Status is self-reported, not proof of an official application.

**Access policy:** A signed-in user may manage only their own application for an opportunity they can see.

This file documents the **immutable initial baseline**. Once the initial migration has been applied, do not edit this SQL or its bundled migration. For future changes to this table/function, create a new versioned file in `supabase/migrations/` and a focused note under `database/changes/<version>/<table>/` instead. See `database/changes/README.md`. Never drop production data to correct a migration.
